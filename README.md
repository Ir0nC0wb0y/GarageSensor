# GarageSensor

This project sets out to create a useable garage sensor using inexpensive parts.

# SW Development Plan:

So far, the development of this project has been on a pro micro (clone). I intend to make a version that uses a NodeMCU (ESP8266 based dev board) to enable wifi usability. To that end, I expect to utilize the WifiManager library (link here?) once the hardware gets ported over to the ESP8266 chip.

# Mechanical Design

While most garages are fully enclosed, mine happens to be missing the 4th side. I will be designing an enclosure that should be relatively waterproof and including those files here (or maybe linked to a thingiverse thing).

# More to follow.
