# GarageSensor

This project sets out to create a useable garage parking distance sensor using inexpensive parts (easily sourced from AliExpress).

# SW Development Plan:

I started this development using a pro micro clone and an ultrasonic sensor using the Arduino IDE. I've since moved on to better things (PlatformIO) and have selected a Wemos D1 mini I had on hand. These changes will become the new master once I've gotten all the features it needs, but I will leave the archive branch.

# Mechanical Design

I am waiting on the hardware to stabilize before the enclosure is designed. I want this to be a single part, but I'm still working through the details in my head how that might work.

# More to follow.
